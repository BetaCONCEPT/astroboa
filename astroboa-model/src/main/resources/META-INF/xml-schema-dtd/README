During the conversion of XSDs to Astroboa definition entities, XSDs are validated by the 
parser. Part of the validation process is to import all necessary XSDs or DTDs dependencies.

Some of these XSDs or DTDs are located externally and thus, can be imported only when an internet access
is available. When this is not the case, XSD parser cannot complete validation and throws an exception.

To avoid this situation (which causes a build to fail or even worse does not allow Astroboa to run), 
Astroboa identifies whether these files can be accessed and if they cannot, it feeds the parser with 
their copy which is located in this directory.
